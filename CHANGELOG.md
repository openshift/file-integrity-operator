## [Unreleased] - Date TBD

### Changes
- the upstream catalog image is now built using the
  [file format](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs/)
  replacing the now deprecated SQLite format.
- We added `initialDelay` option to FileIntegrity CRD to allow users to specify
  the initial delay before the first scan is run. This is useful for
  environments where the operator is deployed before cluster is fully ready.

### Fixes

- Modify the release process to ensure the most recent version is tagged with
  the `latest` tag for the upstream
  [operator](https://quay.io/repository/file-integrity-operator/file-integrity-operator),
  [catalog](https://quay.io/repository/file-integrity-operator/file-integrity-operator-catalog),
  and
  [bundle](https://quay.io/repository/file-integrity-operator/file-integrity-operator-bundle)
  repositories available through quay.io.

### Internal Changes

- Update `make kustomize` to use `go install` for installing kustomize v4. This
  is [necessary](https://github.com/openshift/file-integrity-operator/issues/287)
  for installing kustomize using golang 1.18.

## [0.1.30] - 2022-07-25

### Fixes

- Fixed an [issue](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109153) where
  upgrades from older versions (0.1.24) would fail due to incorrect ownership of
  the File Integrity Operator service accounts. We recommend users upgrade to
  version 0.1.30 to avoid the issue.

## [0.1.29] - 2022-07-19
### Changes

### Fixes

- Restore role bindings for `file-integrity-daemon` to use `Role` instead of
  `ClusterRole`. Using `ClusterRole` inadvertently broke during upgrades due to
  expectations by Operator Lifecycle Manager. No action is required to consume
  this fix besides upgrading to 0.1.29. Please see the [bug
  report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108475) for more
  details.

### Internal Changes

- The `make release-images` target was updated to publish new catalog images
  with each release to
  [quay.io/file-integrity-operator/file-integrity-operator-catalog](https://quay.io/repository/file-integrity-operator/file-integrity-operator-catalog).

## [0.1.28] - 2022-07-14

### Fixes

- Improved contributor experience by making cleanup `make` targets more robust.
- Fixes a [bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104897) where the
  operator isn't able to install into namespaces other than
  `openshift-file-integrity`.
- Expose a new environment variable used by `make catalog-deploy` to deploy the
  operator in a non-default namespace.
- The operator now uses the appropriate labels to prevent
  [warnings](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088201) about
  elevated privileges.

### Internal Changes

- Minor documentation fixes clarifying details of the release process.
- Removed unused `setup-envtest` dependency required by older versions of
  Operator SDK. This is no longer needed since upgrading the Operator SDK
  version.
- Removed unnecessary `make` targets for build directories since `build/` is
  tracked as part of the repository.
- Increased the grace period for end-to-end tests, giving setup functions
  enough time to prepare test environments, reducing transient test failures.
- End-to-end tests now use a pod for generating files for test data instead of
  a daemon set to improve test speeds.

### Documentation

- The File Integrity Operator now explicitly contains an Apache 2.0 License.

## [0.1.27] - 2022-07-06

### Fixes

- The operator now sets the appropriate namespace for `NodeHasIntegrityFailure`
  alerts. This helps users understand what component is raising the alert.
  Please see the corresponding [bug
  report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101393) for more
  details.

## [0.1.26] - 2022-07-01

### Internal Changes

- Included `controller-gen` as a dependency using tools.go.
- Removed remote naming assumptions from `Makefile` release targets, making the
  release process more consistent.
- Added a `deploy-local` target that deploys the operator using the cluster's
  image registry. This is primarily for development purposes.
- Multiple fixes to help stabilize end-to-end testing.

## [0.1.25] - 2022-06-28

### Enhancements

- Added support for using the File Integrity Operator on s390x and ppc64le
  architectures.

### Internal Changes

- Updated operator framework to use operator-sdk version 1.15.0.
- Added formal support for watching all namespaces using `AllNamespaces` in a
  backwards compatible way to adhere to changes required by the operator-sdk
  update.
- Removed unused test framework code that was obsolete after updating the
  operator-sdk framework dependency.
- Added additional flexibility to the container build process to support
  building content across different operating systems.
- Upgraded golang dependency to version 1.17
